    <h2>Establishment & Background</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p> The Walal Bethel Synod is a significant and growing unit of the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus (EECMY).</p>
       <p>Formally established in 2022, it serves as a spiritual and administrative center for numerous congregations across the Kellem Wollega Zone in Western Ethiopia.</p> 
       <p>This document provides a detailed overview of the Synods historical background, vision, mission, organizational structure, challenges, and future strategies, calling for support to further its mission.</p>
      
    <h3>Historical Background</h3>
    <p>
      The origins of the EECMY Walal Bethel Synod are deeply rooted in the early 20th-century missionary efforts of the American Presbyterian Church, particularly the work of Dr. Alexander Lambie, who arrived in Western Ethiopia in 1919. Lambie's medical and evangelistic outreach among the unreached communities of Western Wollega laid the groundwork for a burgeoning evangelical movement. By 1942, these efforts culminated in the establishment of the Western Wollega Bethel Synod (WWBS), marking a major milestone in the history of Ethiopian Protestant Christianity.
      As the Christian population grew, the WWBS faced increasing administrative and geographical challenges, eventually leading to the decision to divide the Synod into smaller, more manageable units. After a decade of careful planning and consultations, the Walal Bethel Synod was officially formed in December 2022, becoming fully operational in January 2023. It now serves 293 congregations with over 145,000 members, 238 pastors and evangelists, and is supported by 12 presbyteries and 4 work areas. The Synod oversees the spiritual and administrative needs of these congregations, providing leadership, pastoral care, and community development. The division of the Western Wollega Bethel Synod into the Walal Bethel Synod was intended to enhance local governance and ministry, allowing for a more effective response to the needs of the rapidly growing congregations.
      The establishment of the Walal Bethel Synod has not only strengthened the administrative capacity of the church but has also revitalized evangelistic efforts in the region. The Synod operates in the Kellem Wollega Zone, particularly in the woredas (districts) of Dalle Wabera, Gawo Kebe, Jimma Horro, Dale Sadi, Lalo Kile, Yubdo and Sadi Chanka fully and Ayira Guliso and Ganji Districts partially. Its work is shaped by a holistic approach to ministry that integrates spiritual growth with social and economic development, a model deeply embedded in the tradition of the EECMY.</p>
